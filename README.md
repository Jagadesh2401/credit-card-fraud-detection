# Credit Card Fraud Detection üí≥

An end-to-end machine learning project for credit card fraud detection. This project demonstrates the process of cleaning and preprocessing transactional data, handling class imbalance with techniques like SMOTE, and training a robust classification model. The final model is deployed in an interactive web application built with Streamlit to classify new transactions in real-time.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Data Analysis:** In-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the transaction dataset.
* **Data Preprocessing:** Scaling numerical features to prepare them for model training.
* **Imbalanced Data Handling:** Utilizes the SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to address the severe class imbalance between fraudulent and legitimate transactions.
* **Machine Learning Model:** Employs an XGBoost classifier, a powerful and efficient model for this type of problem.
* **Interactive Web App:** A user-friendly interface created with Streamlit to demonstrate the model's predictions on custom input.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Python:** Core programming language.
* **Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation and numerical operations.
* **Scikit-learn:** For data preprocessing and model evaluation.
* **Imbalanced-learn:** For the SMOTE implementation.
* **XGBoost:** For the classification model.
* **Streamlit:** For building the interactive web application.
* **Git & Git LFS:** For version control and handling the large dataset.
